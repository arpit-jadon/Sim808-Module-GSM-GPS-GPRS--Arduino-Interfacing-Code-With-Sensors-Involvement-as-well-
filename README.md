the received location will automatically open up in the google maps app.

file--interactive_GSM_GPRS_code: includes the modified version of the above code. It basically
helps in integrating the system with various sensors and according to the output of these sensors
GSM and GPS functioning can be controlled along with triggering other actuators connected to the
